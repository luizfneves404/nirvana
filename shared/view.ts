 *   2. `checkViewHtml` is a static gate the agent can call itself and fix
 *      against — its problem list is the agent's feedback signal.
 *   3. The iframe renders with `sandbox="allow-scripts"` and *no*
 *      `allow-same-origin`, which puts the document on an opaque origin: no
 *      parent DOM, no cookies, no storage. `sealViewHtml` adds the CSP that
 *      closes the last hole, network access.
