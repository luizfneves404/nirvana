 * apart: a view runs on an opaque origin, which reports itself as the string
 * "null" and is shared by every sandboxed frame on the page. Identity has to
 * come from the frame's own window, and the shape from the parsers —
 * everything else on the `message` bus is somebody else's traffic.

 * Returns the latest event rather than taking a callback, so the caller sends
 * it from an effect — the voice socket is reached through a ref, and building a
 * function during render that touches one is what the React Compiler refuses to
